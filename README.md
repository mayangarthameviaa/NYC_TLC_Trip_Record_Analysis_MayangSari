## NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Analysis ##

## Background
This project analyzes taxi trip data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior and operational performance.

## Objective Analysis
This analysis aim to:
- Analyze the differences in taxi trip frequency between weekdays and weekends.  
- Identify the busiest times for taxi trips.  
- Determine the most frequently selected pickup and dropoff zones by customers.  
- Identify the most commonly used payment methods among customers.  
- Discover the most popular booking methods among customers.  
- Measure the impact of congestion on taxi trip duration.  
- Compare the average revenue generated by each vendor.  
- Calculate the total number of trips performed by each vendor.  
- Analyze the total distance traveled for all trips by each vendor.  
- Compare the average revenue across vendors.  
- Determine the total number of trips based on vendors.

## Steps

**1. Data Exploration**
- Conduct exploratory analysis to understand data distribution, outliers, and initial patterns using Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.
- Analyze correlations between variables.
- Visualize the data using scatter plots or heatmaps.
  
**2. Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values and zero values to ensure data completeness.
- Identify and remove outliers to improve data accuracy.
- Format columns to maintain consistency in data types (e.g., datetime and numeric)
- Converting certain numerical values into descriptive categories to simplify analysis.
- Adjusting the time format to match the relevant time zone.
- Creating new columns necessary for analysis, such as day of the week, trip hour, trip duration, and speed.
- 
- Merging the main dataset with relevant supporting data to enrich the analysis.
**3. Data Analysis**
- Answering specific questions based on the analysis objectives.
- Involves calculations, in-depth analysis and visualizations.

**4. Data Visualization**
- Create visualizations in Tableau or Matplotlib/Seaborn to highlight key trends.
  
**5. Insight & Recommendation**
**Insight:**
1. **Weekday vs Weekend Demand**: Demand is higher on weekdays, especially Tuesday, Friday, and Thursday, indicating work-related use. Weekend demand is lower, suggesting an opportunity for promotions to boost demand.
2. **Time-based Demand Patterns**: Peak demand occurs between 12:00 and 13:00, driven by commuters and lunchtime activities. Demand drops late at night, indicating potential for more efficient resource allocation.
3. **Key Pickup and Dropoff Zones**: High-demand zones like East Harlem and Central Harlem are critical for fleet optimization due to their cultural and entertainment significance.
4. **Payment Preferences**: Credit card payments dominate, with cash as the second choice. This highlights the need for convenient, cashless payment systems.
5. **Trip Behavior and Congestion**: Congestion increases trip duration by 15 minutes on average and reduces demand. Efficient routing and incentives during peak congestion could alleviate these issues.
   
**Recommendation:**
1. **Increase Fleet Size:** Add vehicles during peak hours (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM) to reduce wait times. Consider operational costs and use targeted ads to encourage bookings.
2. **Weekend Discounts:** Offer discounts on weekends to boost low demand, but avoid discounts during high-demand times.
3. **Weekdays:** Ensure sufficient taxi availability on Tuesday, Friday, and Thursday.
4. **Weekends:** Offer promotions on weekends to increase demand.

**Pick-Up and Drop-Off Recommendations:**
1. Improve infrastructure with designated areas for pick-up and drop-off in high-demand zones.
2. Partner with events at venues like Central Park and Apollo Theater for ride discounts.
3. Ensure fleet availability during busy periods (11:00 AM - 12:00 PM).
   
**Tips and Payment Methods:**
1. Train drivers for better service to encourage tipping and reward top performers.
2. Focus on promoting credit card payments for ease and tips.
   
**Optimizing Payment Systems:**
1. Optimize credit card payments with contactless options and ensure proper maintenance of payment tools.
2. Handle cash payments efficiently and ensure quick and accurate processing.

**Street-Hail and Dispatch System:**
1. Increase taxi availability in busy areas like business centers and tourist spots.
2. Ensure smooth dispatch operations in remote areas and encourage app usage with promotions.

**Managing Congestion Impact:**
1. Offer incentives to drivers working during peak or congested times to maintain service levels.
2. Use navigation apps to suggest alternative routes and minimize delays caused by traffic.
